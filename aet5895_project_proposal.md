# AET5895 Project Proposal

This plugin was designed to solve an issue that I have been working through. I most likely will never have the opportunity to track an analog console to tape and then mixing on the desk again. And thats fine with me. Tape can be a pain, and reduces your ability to edit. To get around this for my recent mixing I have been simulating an analog tracking signal chain. I'll do all my edits and then commit a specific series of plugins afterwards. The chain consists of several plugins the first being decapitator usually using the models A or N which are ampex and neve respectively. Next I'll use a basic three band EQ like the TDR slickEQ to do some basic highpassing, or gentle EQ moves. Then I will use any inserts like a compressor subtly. I'll finally push it into a tape machine plugin something like the waves J37. 

From reading that you can tell that it is a pain in the butt to do at the start of every mix. It sounds nice but is rarely worth the effort. Something like Harrison mixbus would be easier to use but the editing is not as quick as pro tools. Hence my plan for this plugin. The plugin designed to emulate tracking, will have a few small modules in it. I picked the algorithms based on reading the textbook, choosing algorithms with a lower total harmonic distortion. The first module in the chain would be a preamp, using an exponential distortion algorithm followed by a high pass and low pass filter (which is what I need to learn about.) Next would be a very small distortion to emulate tape.

When I plan on a piece of software, I note the key features, and then what I call stretch goals, things you can add after version one. The key features for this plugin is the two the preamp and tape machine modules, with filters, with individual input and output gain, and controls for each parameter. The stretch goals from ease to challenging are turning off specific modules, add some subtle EQ to the preamp section to give character to the distortion, cascading gain option kinda like the JHS colour box, and possibly some dynamic range reduction to smooth out transients.
